I have developed this app with the help of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, and a Weather API. This is a fully responsive app with a response time of less than 0.0001 seconds. The app provides the following functionality:

Live weather updates of the searched city
Sunrise and sunset times of the searched city
Live temperature of the searched city
Real-time "feels like" temperature of the searched city
Humidity of the searched city
Wind speed of the searched city
Pressure of the searched city
Additionally, the app allows users to change the temperature measurement scale from Celsius (°C) to Fahrenheit (°F).
